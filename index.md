## About Me

I am a final year CS Ph.D. student at National University of Singapore. I am fortunate to be advised by [Tiow-Seng Tan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tants/).
I am visiting [Herbert Edelsbrunner](http://pub.ist.ac.at/~edels/)'s Group at IST Austria from October 2024.

My research interests include convex optimization, computational geometry, and parallel computing (GPGPU). I have a broad interest in both theoretical and practical aspects of algorithm design.

I like exploring new places through travel. See my [Traveled Map](https://www.traveledmap.com/traveledmap/ucVLxEPziIOkZsbl93EvfEJiBAh2).
